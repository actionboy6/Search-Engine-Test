# Search Engine Test

The majority of the code is complete, but now comes the debugging part. When I go to search an item in the search bar, Borderlands 2 pops up after a search, but that's the only thing that pops up. I type in other titles, and they don't pop up. Further investigation is necessary. 
Update: Somehow the /div tag was not present after each item listed. 

Now, I am going to try and add some filters to the search engine. If I can't get it working, I'll psuedo code the entire thing amd submit it because I don't want to risk breaking the engine. 
Update: So I am able to filter the search by an h2 tag, but I am unable to get a secondary h3 tag search working. I will psuedo code my attempt to call a secondary h3 tag, just so it exists, but it won't break the working code.
