# Search Engine Test
 This is a test for EP Carbon

Hey Mon, hopefully this test meets or exceeds your criteria. While I have a feeling that this project will take longer than a few hours, I'm committed to getting this thing working. Coding is stressful enough, at least it is for me, so I decided to have a little fun. If you do decide to hire me, one thing you'll notice is I like to use memes a lot. You already saw my merge conflict during the zoom call, and I extended that to Madden 23.

The majority of the code is complete, but now comes the debugging part. When I go to search an item in the search bar, Borderlands 2 pops up after a search, but that's the only thing that pops up. I type in other titles, and they don't pop up. Further investigation is necessary. 
Update: Somehow the </div> tag was not present after each item listed. 

Now, I am going to try and add some filters to the search engine. If I can't get it working, I'll psuedo code the entire thing amd submit it because I don't want to risk breaking the engine. 
Update: So I am able to filter the search by an <h2> tag, but I am unable to get a secondary <h3> tag search working. I will psuedo code my attempt to call a secondary <h3> tag, just so it exists, but it won't break the working code.
